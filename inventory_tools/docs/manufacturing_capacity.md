# Manufacturing Capacity Report

Manufacturing Capacity is a report-based interface that, given a BOM and Warehouse, displays the demand and in-stock quantities for the entire hierarchy of any BOM tree containing that BOM. Once the filters are set, the report traverses the BOM tree to find the top-level parents of the given BOM. From there, it finds total demand based on outstanding Sales Orders, Material Requests (of type "Manufacture"), and Work Orders, adjusting for any overlap. In stock quantities for each level are determined based on the selected Warehouse. The Parts Can Build quantity is based on what is in stock (for non-BOM rows) or the minimum Parts can Build of sub-levels for BOM rows. The calculation assumes that the quantity demanded is one "part" so if the in stock quantity is less than the demanded quantity, then zero "parts" can be built.

There are rows for all levels of the BOM hierarchy - the Pie itself, sub-level rows for each sub-assembly of the Pie Crust and Pie Filling, with rows below each of those for the raw materials comprising each BOM. Columns include the BOM, Item, Description, Quantity per Parent BOM, BOM UoM, Demanded Quantity, In Stock Quantity, Parts Can Build quantity, and the Difference Quantity (demanded quantity less parts can build quantity).](./assets/manufacturing_capacity_report.png)
